## Motivation

We just want to replicate all the features that [opensource](https://github.com/developersdo/opensource/) has just for fun and at the same time to introduce more people to the open-source community. This is an excellent project for someone who wants to learn Vue.
The data source in order to make this work will be:

1. https://developersdo.github.io/opensource/data/repos.json
2. https://developersdo.github.io/opensource/data/users.json
